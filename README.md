ag-js-2

This is an embellishment of ag-js.

This is the 2nd step in a continuum of steps from ag-js to a (more) final version.

This shows how to carve out the callback logic and to make it into a separate part.

Timeout is still tangled up with the callback logic and will be moved into a separate part nin another step, later.

Learn what you can from this version, then move on.



See: "HTML Components - Handling Callback Logic Explicity"https://github.com/guitarvydas/ag-js-2/blob/master/HTML%20Components%20-%20Handling%20Callback%20Logic%20Explicitly.pdf, example.html and drawing.drawio.  When running the example, choose test.txt as the sample file to open and read.
